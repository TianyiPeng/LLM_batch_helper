    "response_text": "The square root of 64 is 8. \n\nTo calculate the square root, you can think of it as finding a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 64. In this case:\n\n8 \u00d7 8 = 64.\n\nAlternatively, you could use estimation or factorization methods. Since 64 is a perfect square, it can be broken down into its prime factors:\n\n64 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = \\(2^6\\).\n\nWhen finding the square root of \\(2^6\\), you take half of the exponent, which gives you \\(2^{6/2} = 2^3 = 8\\). \n\nThus, the square root of",
